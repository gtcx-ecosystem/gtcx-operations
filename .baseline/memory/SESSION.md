# Session: Baseline Initialization

## What Was Done
- Synchronized `.baseline/` structure with canonical schema
- Synced `definition.json` from baseline-os
- Discovered 1 architectural patterns from codebase
- Discovered 0 active TODOs/FIXMEs in code
- Scanned package.json for ecosystem dependencies
- Initialized memory files with repo-specific content (not generic templates)

## Files Modified
- .baseline/definition.json (synced)
- .baseline/memory/README.md (updated)
- .baseline/memory/SESSION.md (created)
- .baseline/memory/PATTERNS.md (enriched with discovered patterns)
- .baseline/memory/PITFALLS.md (enriched with discovered issues)
- .baseline/memory/DEPENDENCIES.md (enriched with discovered deps)

## Key Findings
- Tech stack: See PATTERNS.md
- Active issues: See PITFALLS.md
- Dependencies: See DEPENDENCIES.md

## Next Steps
- Review discovered patterns for accuracy
- Resolve TODOs/FIXMEs flagged in PITFALLS.md
- Verify ecosystem dependencies in DEPENDENCIES.md
- Re-run `baseline-init` after significant repo changes
